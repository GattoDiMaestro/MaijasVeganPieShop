                <p style="font-family: verdana;">
                    For many years, <strong>Maija</strong> has been baking the most delicious vegan pies at her home. In
                    2013,
                    we opened our first store in <i>Helsinki (Finland)</i> in a cosy little street the Grand Market.
                    People from all over the world fell in love with the soft cakes, heavenly cakes, spicy apple pies...
                    <i>store became a success in no time.</i> <br><br>In 2015, no less than 100 pies were sold every day
                    and Maija's
                    Vegan Pie Shop moved into a larger building. After receiving many requests, it became clear that our
                    next step was making it possible to order pies from the comfort of your own home and
                    from anywhere in the world. You are now looking at the result of this: our very own webstore,
                    making it possible to order Bethany's delicious pies whenever oyu feel like it!
